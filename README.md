## Lab 11, 12, 13

## Project

Create a product selection site that allows user to click their favorite product as a series of 3 images comes up. The images are set up in an array to not show up more than once in two rounds. After 25 rounds, the user click view results and a chart showing the metrics of views/clicks posts. The site has local storage added, so the data can be aggregated even after a page refresh.

### Reflections

- Set-up. Setting up the repo, added all the json, reset and gitignore files, then created the index.html, style.css and app.js files. This is getting easier now that I create the files in VSCode and copy the rest of the reset files from the class repo. Dang, does this mean I am learning?

- Lab 11. Went into this lab very confident, but it's amzaing how that confidence can shatter when you miss a few hours of classtime. I am trying to do the flexbox froggy and grid garden to work on CSS. But I think my JS needs some work, as I can't remember the functions needed to make the magic happen. Unfortunately, my head head has not been in the game this week due to personal issues at home. I just hope my head can get screwed back on soon.

- Lab 12. Forgot to add these reflections when turning in late. This was pretty easy following along with the video Ryan posted. I was able to catch up quickly. The only issues I really had were with how I setup my grid in css. The styling made it more difficult to move around because I had my grids wrong.

- Lab 13. I forgot about adding the retrieved objects to the allProducts array. Once Ryan helped with that, my chart rendered and stored properly. Tried to do some color gradients for the background with CSS to spiff it up. But I cannot seem to change the grid-line colors on my chart. I googled and found a few references, but whenever I attempted them, my images broke. So, I settled for a slightly less readable chart, rather than broken product pictures.
