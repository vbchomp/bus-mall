### Reflections

- Set-up. Setting up the repo, added all the json, reset and gitignore files, then created the index.html, style.css and app.js files. This is getting easier now that I create the files in VSCode and copy the rest of the reset files from the class repo. Dang, does this mean I am learning?

- Lab 11. Went into this lab very confident, but it's amzaing how that confidence can shatter when you miss a few hours of classtime. I am trying to do the flexbox froggy and grid garden to work on CSS. But I think my JS needs some work, as I can't remember the functions needed to make the magic happen. Unfortunately, my head head has not been in the game this week due to personal issues at home. I just hope my head can get screwed back on soon.
